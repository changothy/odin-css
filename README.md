# odin-css
This project aims to replicate the reference images provided by The Odin Project by using CSS skills taught in the Foundations course.

The objective of this project is to:
- Demonstrate CSS fundamentals
- Achieve a website layout using CSS and Flexbox

## Thoughts
I struggled a little with flexbox during the exercises, but visualising the design as a collection of rows/columns helped. Definitely easier than what I remember doing decades ago.
Working on the HTML first then the CSS was a good move. I also preferred separating styling from layout in the stylesheet.
